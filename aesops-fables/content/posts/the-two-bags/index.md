EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world with two bags suspended from his neck all bag in front full of his neighborsâ€™ faults, and a large bag behind filled with his own faults. Hence it is that men are quick to see the faults of others, and yet are often blind to their own failings.
